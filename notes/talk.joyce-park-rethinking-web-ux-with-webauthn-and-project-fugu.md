## Abstract

Devs still may not realize that browsers are now on the cusp of enabling far more advanced capabilities via efforts like Webauthn and Project Fugu. This will allow developers to more effectively mix the business case for no-download PWAs and web with the native capabilities of current hardware. Weâ€™ll go through demos and sample code for some fun new types of web interactions, including biometric authentication, voice recognition, Bluetooth device integration, and ML-recognized gestures.

## Notes

### Notes by [kevin](https://github.com/kevinslin)
- two types of builders: plumbers (make tools and infrastructure) and carpenters (make user-facing apps)
- building an app to help people connect faster IRL (can't demo yet)
- "there are a lot of things the web can do now that can revolutionize our UX"
- Project Fugu
    - Google-led attempt to match native UX on web
    - https://developer.chrome.com/blog/fugu-showcase/
- Demos

- ML driven UX

- caveats
    - Safari
    - performance can be an issue
    - PWAs are misunderstood by the masses (user education)
- takeaway: understand new things browsers can do for us, make things cooler

  > all slides were left behind, ahd to re-create slides

- speaker bio
  - plumbers: toosl and infrastructure
  - carpenters: user facing apps
  - speaker is a carpenter
  - currently building an app to help people connect faster IRL 

- context
  - for past few years, been possible to stroe lots of info on web apps
  - this is paradigm changing, like XHR

- ux is boring now
- toolkits are good
- app downloads and usage are down

- what is fugue
  - google led attempt to match native ux
  - apple has not played along, not much progress

- webauthn (this is fido2)
  - replace passwords with biometrics

- demo
  - web usb
  - file system access api

- ml driven ux
  - image classification eg
    - banana demo
  - voice recognition

- caveats
  - safari
  - perf
  - pwas are misunderstood
